## Spear Reviews

### [Cold Steel Assegai — Short Shaft](/spears/assegai-short/)
**Best for:** Apartments, tight spaces, beginners

The entry-level option. At 41.5 inches, it's maneuverable enough for hallways and staircases while still giving you serious reach advantage. The Zulu design has been proven in actual warfare — it works.

**Price:** ~$40-60 | **[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Assegai-Spear-Short/dp/B004YWK74E)**

---

### [Cold Steel Assegai — Long Shaft](/spears/assegai-long/)
**Best for:** Large homes, open floor plans, maximum intimidation

Nearly 7 feet of standoff distance. Perfect for defending doorways, staircases, or large rooms. The psychological deterrent alone is worth the price — nobody expects to face a Zulu war spear in a suburban home.

**Price:** ~$50-70 | **[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Assegai-Secure-Ex-Sheath/dp/B004YWJWXQ)**

---

### [Cold Steel Boar Spear](/spears/boar-spear/)
**Best for:** Maximum stopping power, dedicated defense rooms, rural properties

The serious option. 18-inch blade, crossbar for stopping charging threats, and 7+ feet of reach. Overkill for most situations, but that's the point. If you want absolute certainty, this is it.

**Price:** ~$70-90 | **[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-95BOASK-Secure-Ex-Sheath/dp/B004N0KVTS)**
