# Cold Steel Assegai — Short Shaft

## The Classic Zulu Design, Modernized

The Assegai was invented by the legendary Zulu king Shaka in the early 1800s. It revolutionized warfare in southern Africa. Now Cold Steel has brought this proven design into the 21st century — and it turns out your hallway is a lot like a narrow African battlefield.

## Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Overall Length** | 41.5 inches |
| **Head Length** | 13.3 inches |
| **Head Width** | 2.5 inches |
| **Steel** | SK-5 Medium Carbon |
| **Weight** | ~28 oz (head + shaft) |
| **Shaft Material** | Ash Wood |
| **Includes** | Secure-Ex Sheath |

## Why It Works for Home Defense

### Maneuverability
At just over 3 feet, the short shaft version is perfect for indoor spaces. Corners? Tight hallways? Staircases? You can actually swing this thing without embedding it in your drywall.

### Reach Advantage
Even the short version gives you 3+ feet of standoff distance. A home invader with a knife has to get past 41 inches of steel first. Good luck with that.

### The "Oh Shit" Factor
Let's be honest: there's a psychological component here. Someone breaks into your home, expecting a scared homeowner with maybe a golf club. Instead they find you holding a *Zulu war spear*. The expression on their face alone is worth the price.

### Silence
No muzzle flash. No deafening bang. No alerting every neighbor within three blocks. Just a quiet, effective deterrent that won't damage your hearing or your home's resale value.

## Legal Considerations

Unlike firearms, spears aren't regulated by the ATF. No background checks. No waiting periods. No registration (in most jurisdictions — check your local laws, obviously). 

It's a piece of sporting equipment. That happens to be lethally effective at close quarters.

## Maintenance

- Keep the edge sharp (it comes sharp enough, but a quick touch-up never hurts)
- Oil the shaft occasionally to prevent drying
- Store it somewhere accessible but secure

## Bottom Line

**Price:** ~$40-60 ([Check current price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Assegai-Spear-Short/dp/B004YWK74E))

**Verdict:** Best entry-level home defense spear. Maneuverable, effective, and just absurd enough to make you smile while holding it.
