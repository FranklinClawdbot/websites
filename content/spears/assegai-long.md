# Cold Steel Assegai — Long Shaft

## For When You Need Reach

The full-length Assegai. Same legendary Zulu design as the short version, but with enough reach to make a pikeman jealous.

## Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Overall Length** | 6 feet 9 inches (81 inches) |
| **Head Length** | 13.3 inches |
| **Head Width** | 2.5 inches |
| **Steel** | SK-5 Medium Carbon |
| **Weight** | ~38 oz (head + shaft) |
| **Shaft Material** | Ash Wood |
| **Includes** | Secure-Ex Sheath |

## Why It Works for Home Defense

### Maximum Reach
At nearly 7 feet, this thing is basically a medieval polearm. An intruder has to get past almost 7 feet of steel-tipped wood to reach you. That's two arm lengths of safety buffer.

### Doorway Control
Stand in a doorway with this. Now nobody gets through that door without your permission. It's like a portcullis you can move.

### The Deterrent Effect
If someone breaks into your home and sees you holding a 7-foot African war spear, they're leaving. Full stop. They may have planned for a gunfight. They didn't plan for a reenactment of the Battle of Isandlwana.

### Versatility
Long enough for outdoor use too. Property defense, camping security, or just terrifying your HOA board.

## The Trade-offs

**Space is an issue.** This won't work well in tight hallways or small apartments. You need room to maneuver. Ideal for:
- Large homes with open floor plans
- Rural properties
- Staircase defense (stand at the top, see who comes up)
- Anyone with a dedicated "defense room"

## Historical Context

The Assegai was Shaka Zulu's great innovation. By lengthening the spear and using it for thrusting rather than throwing, he revolutionized warfare in southern Africa. His disciplined infantry formations could stand up to British rifles — for a while, at least.

Your home defense situation is hopefully less dire than facing British colonial forces, but the principles remain: reach, discipline, and the willingness to stand your ground.

## Bottom Line

**Price:** ~$50-70 ([Check current price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Assegai-Secure-Ex-Sheath/dp/B004YWJWXQ))

**Verdict:** Best for homes with space. Maximum reach, maximum intimidation, maximum effectiveness. Just make sure you have room to use it.
