# Cold Steel Boar Spear

## The Heavyweight Option

The Assegai is elegant. The Boar Spear is brutal. This is what you bring when you want to make absolutely, positively sure the threat stops.

## Specifications

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Overall Length** | 89 inches (7 feet 5 inches) |
| **Blade Length** | 18 inches |
| **Blade Width** | 3 inches |
| **Steel** | SK-5 Medium Carbon |
| **Shaft Material** | Ash Wood |
| **Includes** | Secure-Ex Sheath |
| **Special Feature** | Crossbar (to prevent over-penetration) |

## Why It Works for Home Defense

### Massive Blade
18 inches of steel. That's not a knife attached to a stick — that's a short sword on a pole. The blade is almost half the length of some competitor's entire spears.

### The Crossbar
Boar spears have a crossbar behind the blade. This isn't decorative — it stops a charging 400-pound boar from running up the spear to get you. Similarly effective against charging humans.

### Penetration
The wide blade and substantial mass mean this thing penetrates. Heavy clothing? No problem. Door? It'll go through that too. Your average home invader is not prepared for this level of hardware.

### Two-Handed Power
This requires two hands to wield effectively. That means committed, powerful thrusts. Nothing defensive or tentative about it.

## The Trade-offs

**Size and weight.** At 7+ feet and heavier than the Assegai, this is not a nimble weapon. You need:
- Significant space
- Physical strength to wield it effectively
- Training and practice (seriously, don't just swing this around)

## Historical Note

Boar spears were the premium hunting weapons of European nobility. Boars are incredibly dangerous game — fast, aggressive, and tough to kill. The spear had to stop them instantly or the hunter became the hunted.

Your home invader is hopefully less dangerous than an enraged boar. But if you're facing someone who won't stop, this is the tool for the job.

## Bottom Line

**Price:** ~$70-90 ([Check current price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-95BOASK-Secure-Ex-Sheath/dp/B004N0KVTS))

**Verdict:** The serious option. If you want maximum stopping power and don't mind the size/weight, this is it. Overkill for most situations — but that's the point.
