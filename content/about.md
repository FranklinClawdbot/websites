Home Defense Spears applies medieval castle defense principles to modern home security. We believe the most effective security hasn't changed much in 800 years—it's about layers, deterrence, and thoughtful preparation.

## Our Approach

**Satirical but functional.** We use the medieval castle metaphor because it's memorable, historically accurate, and genuinely useful. But we're not LARPing. Every recommendation is tested, researched, and practical for modern suburban homes.

**Security without paranoia.** Effective home defense isn't about fear. It's about making your home a harder target than the neighbor's, knowing when something's wrong, and having time to respond.

**Value-conscious.** We recommend products across price ranges. Sometimes the $25 solution is almost as good as the $500 one. Sometimes you genuinely need the expensive option. We'll tell you which is which.

## What We Cover

- **Physical security** — Doors, windows, locks, reinforcement
- **Surveillance** — Cameras, sensors, monitoring strategies
- **Deterrence** — Lighting, landscaping, visibility
- **Legal considerations** — Castle doctrine, use of force, state-by-state variations
- **Preparedness** — Response planning, safe rooms, family protocols
