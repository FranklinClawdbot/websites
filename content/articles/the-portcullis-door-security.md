Medieval castles didn't rely on a single lock on the main gate. They used portcullises—heavy metal grilles that could drop in seconds to seal the entrance. Your front door? It probably has a flimsy deadbolt and a striker plate held in by half-inch screws.

Let's fix that.

## The Brutal Truth About Front Doors

Most residential front doors can be kicked open in under 10 seconds. The average door jamb is 3/4-inch pine held in place by three half-inch screws. You might as well have a sign that says "Welcome burglars, please kick here."

In medieval terms, it's like having a gate with no portcullis, no guards, and a simple wooden bar that a determined man could snap with his shoulder.

## Layer 1: The Door Itself

Before you add any reinforcement, evaluate what you're protecting:

** Hollow core doors:** These are interior doors that somehow ended up on exterior frames. Replace immediately. They're about as secure as cardboard.

**Solid wood doors:** Better, but check the wood type. Pine is soft and splinters. Oak or maple holds up better.

**Steel doors:** Excellent choice, but make sure the steel is substantial (at least 22 gauge) and that the door frame is equally reinforced.

**Fiberglass doors:** Surprisingly good. They resist denting and cracking better than steel in extreme climates, and quality ones have steel reinforcement inside.

**Our recommendation:** A solid steel or fiberglass door from a reputable manufacturer like [Therma-Tru](https://amzn.to/) or [Masonite](https://amzn.to/). Expect to spend $200-500 for a quality door.

## Layer 2: The Strike Plate

This is where the deadbolt engages with the door frame. By default, it's probably a flimsy piece of brass held in by two short screws directly into the door jamb. One good kick and that jamb splits.

**The fix:** Install a [security strike plate](https://amzn.to/) with 3-inch screws that reach the structural framing behind the door jamb. Better yet, install a [strike plate box](https://amzn.to/) that wraps around the jamb on all sides.

This takes 20 minutes and costs $15-30. It increases your door's kick resistance by 500%. Medieval engineers would approve.

## Layer 3: The Deadbolt

Not all deadbolts are created equal. Look for:

- **Grade 1 certification** (ANSI/BHMA) — this is commercial grade
- **1-inch throw** — the bolt extends a full inch into the strike plate
- **Hardened steel construction** — resist cutting and sawing
- **Reinforced collar** — protects the cylinder from wrenching

**Good options:**
- [Schlage B60N](https://amzn.to/) — affordable Grade 1, about $35
- [Medeco Maxum](https://amzn.to/) — high security, pick-resistant, about $200
- [Mul-T-Lock Junior](https://amzn.to/) — excellent high-security option

Avoid anything with "bump key" vulnerabilities (most basic Kwikset and Schlage models). If your deadbolt costs less than $20, it offers decoration, not security.

## Layer 4: Door Frame Reinforcement

The door can be perfect, but if the frame is weak, an attacker just kicks the frame instead of the door.

**Solutions:**

1. **Door frame reinforcement kit** — [Door Armor](https://amzn.to/) or similar systems reinforce the jamb, hinges, and lock area with steel plates. About $70.

2. **Long hinge screws** — Replace the short screws in your hinges with 3-inch screws that reach the framing. Free if you have a screwdriver.

3. **Security bars** — A [door jammer](https://amzn.to/) or [security bar](https://amzn.to/) for when you're home. These work like portcullises—physical barriers that stop the door from opening even if the lock is defeated.

## Layer 5: The Weak Points Around the Door

Don't forget:

**Window panels** — Side lights and door windows are easy entry points. Use [window film](https://amzn.to/) to make glass harder to break and enter through.

**Door viewers** — You should be able to see who's outside without opening the door. If you don't have a peephole, install one. Better yet, a [video doorbell](https://amzn.to/) (Ring, Nest, or similar) acts as your castle sentry.

**Hinges** — If hinges are on the outside, an attacker can remove the pins. Use [hinge pins with security tabs](https://amzn.to/) or ensure your door has at least one hinge with a non-removable pin.

## Installation Priority

If you can only do one thing this weekend:

1. **Install a security strike plate with 3-inch screws** — 20 minutes, $15, 5x improvement
2. **Add long screws to hinges** — 10 minutes, $0
3. **Evaluate upgrading your deadbolt** — if your current one is Grade 2 or lower

Everything else can wait, but these three are non-negotiable.

## The Portcullis Analogy

A portcullis wasn't just a locked gate. It was:
- Heavy (hard to force)
- Metal (hard to cut)
- Drop-down (always ready, no setup time)
- Grilled (could be lowered while defenders still fought)

Your reinforced door should offer the same: always ready, physically imposing, and designed to buy you time.
