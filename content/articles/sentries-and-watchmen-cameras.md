A medieval castle without sentries isn't a castle. It's a tomb waiting to happen. Those sentries weren't just watching for armies on the horizon—they caught thieves in the market, spotted fires before they spread, and noticed when something felt wrong.

Your security cameras are your sentries. But unthinking sentries who never sleep, never get bored, and (if you set them up right) never miss what matters.

## What Cameras Actually Do

Before we talk placement, understand what cameras accomplish:

1. **Detection** — Knowing someone is approaching
2. **Deterrence** — Making attackers choose easier targets
3. **Documentation** — Recording what happened for police/insurance
4. **Verification** — Confirming if that noise was a threat or a raccoon

Cameras don't stop determined attackers. They help you respond faster and smarter.

## The Castle Approach to Camera Placement

Medieval sentries stood on towers for a reason: height and visibility. They could see approaching threats before those threats saw them. Your cameras should work the same way.

### Position 1: The Main Approach (Your Drawbridge)

**Where:** Covering your driveway, walkway, or primary entrance path.

**Why:** This is your early warning system. You want to see someone coming while they're still 30+ feet from your door.

**Specs:**
- Wide angle (120°+) to capture the full approach
- Motion detection with smart zones (ignore passing cars, alert on people)
- Night vision essential
- Two-way audio useful ("Can I help you?" from safety)

**Recommended:** [Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2](https://amzn.to/) or [Nest Doorbell](https://amzn.to/) for the door itself. Add a [higher-mounted camera](https://amzn.to/) covering the approach path.

### Position 2: The Gatehouse (Your Front Door)

**Where:** Directly at your main entrance, covering anyone at the door.

**Why:** Facial recognition for police, package theft protection, verification before opening.

**Specs:**
- Eye-level or slightly above (captures faces, not just tops of heads)
- Wide dynamic range (handles backlight from sun)
- Clear audio (hear what they say)

**Note:** This shouldn't be your only door camera. By the time someone is at your door, you're in reactive mode.

### Position 3: The Walls (Perimeter)

**Where:** Corners of your house covering side yards, backyards, and blind spots.

**Why:** Most break-ins don't happen through the front door. They happen through side windows, back doors, or garage entries—places neighbors can't see.

**Specs:**
- Weather-resistant (IP65 or better)
- Long night vision range (30+ feet)
- Motion-activated floodlight integration
- Local storage option (cloud-only cameras fail when internet fails)

**Recommended:** [Arlo Pro 4](https://amzn.to/), [Reolink Argus 3](https://amzn.to/), or wired [Amcrest](https://amzn.to/) systems.

### Position 4: The Inner Keep (Interior)

**Where:** Main living areas or hallways, positioned high with wide angles.

**Why:** If they get past your perimeter, you need to know where they are inside. Also useful for validating insurance claims and checking on pets/family.

**Privacy consideration:** Never put cameras in bedrooms or bathrooms. Focus on entry points and main areas.

**Recommended:** [Wyze Cam](https://amzn.to/) for budget ($25), [Nest Cam Indoor](https://amzn.to/) for integration.

## Common Camera Mistakes

**The "Front Door Only" Setup**
You catch the pizza delivery. You miss the burglar entering through the back window. Always assume attackers will avoid your most obvious camera.

**Too High**
Cameras mounted under eaves look down on heads. You get great shots of baseball caps. Mount cameras at face height or angle them carefully.

**Ignoring Lighting**
Night vision works, but it has limits. Motion-activated floodlights turn your cameras from grainy IR to crisp color footage. Plus, lights are a deterrent.

**Trusting Batteries**
Battery cameras are convenient but die at the worst times. Solar panels help. Wired power is best for critical positions.

**Forgetting About WiFi**
Cameras need reliable internet. Position your router strategically, use WiFi extenders, or run ethernet (Powerline adapters work well).

## The Spec Sheet: What to Look For

| Feature | Minimum | Preferred | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Resolution | 1080p | 2K or 4K | 1080p is fine; higher helps with faces at distance |
| Night Vision | 20 feet | 40+ feet | IR LEDs or color night vision |
| Field of View | 110° | 140°+ | Wider captures more, but distorts at edges |
| Weather Rating | IP65 | IP67 | Higher numbers = more weatherproof |
| Storage | Cloud | Cloud + Local (SD/NVR) | Redundancy matters; internet fails |
| Smart Detection | Motion | Person/vehicle/animal | Reduces false alerts |
| Audio | One-way | Two-way | Speak to visitors/deter intruders |
| Power | Battery | Wired or solar | Reliability over convenience |

## Systems vs. Cameras

**All-in-One Systems (easiest)**
- Ring (Amazon ecosystem)
- Nest (Google ecosystem)
- SimpliSafe (security-focused)
- Arlo (flexible, wire-free options)

These integrate cameras, doorbells, sensors, and monitoring. Good for most people.

**DIY Mix and Match (most flexible)**
- Cameras: Reolink, Amcrest, Hikvision
- NVR: Blue Iris, Frigate, ZoneMinder
- Storage: Local NAS or NVR

Cheaper long-term, more control, but requires technical setup.

## Budget Tiers

**Basic ($100-300):**
- One video doorbell
- One backyard camera
- Self-monitoring

**Better ($500-800):**
- Video doorbell
- 3-4 perimeter cameras
- Some internal coverage
- Motion-activated lights

**Best ($1,500+):**
- Full perimeter coverage (6+ cameras)
- All entry points covered
- 24/7 recording (not just motion)
- Professional monitoring option
- Video verification for alarms

## Beyond the Hardware

Cameras are only useful if someone watches them. That means:

**Smart Alerts:** Configure your system to only alert on people, not squirrels. Review and tune weekly until it's right.

**Response Plan:** When you get an alert at 2 AM, what do you do? Have a protocol: check the feed, call 911 if needed, don't go investigate personally.

**Maintenance:** Clean lenses monthly. Check that night vision works. Test motion detection. Update firmware.

**Privacy:** Use strong passwords. Enable two-factor authentication. Segment cameras on isolated network if you're paranoid (and you should be).

## The Bottom Line

Medieval sentries worked because they were positioned well, trained to spot threats, and part of a larger defense system. Your cameras should be the same:

- Cover approaches, not just entry points
- Integrate with lighting and alarms
- Alert intelligently
- Be maintained and monitored

A camera that isn't watched is a decoration. A camera positioned poorly is evidence that doesn't help. Do it right, or don't do it at all.
