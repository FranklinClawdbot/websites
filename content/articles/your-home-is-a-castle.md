In the year 1265, a castle steward faced a problem remarkably similar to yours: how to protect everything he valued behind a single front door. He didn't have Ring cameras or smart locks, but he understood something most modern homeowners have forgotten—**security is about layers, not gadgets.**

Welcome to Home Defense Spears, where we apply medieval wisdom to modern threats. This isn't about living in fear or turning your suburban home into a fortress. It's about understanding that effective home security hasn't changed much in 800 years. The principles that kept kings safe can keep your family safe too.

## Why Castles Matter

Medieval castles weren't just fancy houses. They were the most advanced security systems of their time, designed by people who genuinely understood that their lives depended on getting it right. Every feature—from the moat to the murder holes—solved a specific security problem.

And here's the thing: **burglars haven't evolved much.** They're still looking for easy targets, quick entry points, and fast exits. The same principles that stopped medieval raiders work just as well against modern intruders.

## The Seven Layers of Defense

Castles were built in layers, each designed to slow down an attacker:

1. **The Moat** — Your outer perimeter (yard, lighting, visibility)
2. **The Walls** — Your exterior barriers (doors, windows, garage)
3. **The Gatehouse** — Your controlled entry points
4. **The Portcullis** — Your door reinforcement
5. **The Courtyard** — Your interior spaces
6. **The Keep** — Your safe room
7. **The Watch** — Your monitoring systems

We'll cover each of these in detail in upcoming articles. For now, understand this: **no single layer makes you secure. It's the combination that works.** The moat alone won't save you. The walls alone won't save you. But together? Now you're thinking like a castle steward.

## The Mindset Shift

Modern home security marketing wants you to believe that buying the right camera or alarm system will solve your problems. It's not that simple.

The castle approach requires two things:

1. **Systems thinking** — Understanding how layers work together
2. **Active defense** — Not just installing equipment, but using it intentionally

A castle with a portcullis but no sentries isn't secure. A castle with sentries but no walls isn't secure. Your home is the same.

## What This Site Is (And Isn't)

**This site is:**
- Practical advice based on proven principles
- Product reviews that actually test the gear
- Historical context that makes the lessons stick
- Respectful of your intelligence and budget

**This site isn't:**
- Paranoid bunker-building advice
- A shill for expensive security systems
- Legal advice (we'll cite the laws, but consult a lawyer for your situation)
- About firearms (we're focused on deterrence and prevention, not combat)

## The Short Version

If you want to secure your home like a castle, remember:

- **Deter** — Make your home look like more trouble than it's worth
- **Detect** — Know when someone's approaching
- **Delay** — Slow them down if they try to enter
- **Defend** — Have a plan if they get through

That's the castle formula, and it works.
