# Why Spears?

## The Question Everyone Asks

"Why not just get a gun?"

Fair question. Here's the honest answer:

## Guns Are Loud

A 12-gauge shotgun indoors produces about 160 decibels. That's instant, permanent hearing damage. You'll be deaf for the rest of the fight — and potentially for life. 

A spear is silent. You can defend your home without destroying your hearing or waking every neighbor within three blocks.

## Guns Require Training

Real talk: most gun owners don't train enough. Under stress, with adrenaline flooding your system, fine motor skills disappear. That front sight you practiced with at the range? Good luck seeing it at 3 AM when someone's kicking down your door.

A spear is intuitive. Pointy end goes into the bad guy. You've been poking things with sticks since you were five.

## Guns Have Legal Complexity

Background checks. Waiting periods. Registration requirements. Storage laws. Transport restrictions. The ATF. State-by-state variations. Accidentally carry into the wrong building and you're a felon.

A spear is sporting equipment. You can buy it online and have it shipped to your door in most states. No paperwork. No waiting. No permits.

## Guns Can Miss

Under stress, even trained shooters miss. Bullets go through walls, endangering family members in other rooms. And once you're out of ammunition, you have an expensive club.

A spear doesn't run out of ammo. It doesn't over-penetrate (it stops in the target). And at home-defense distances, missing is hard — the thing is 4-7 feet long.

## The "But What About..." Questions

### "What if they have a gun?"

Then you're in a gunfight, which you probably lose regardless of your weapon choice. But here's the thing: most home invasions aren't expecting armed resistance *at all*. The sight of you holding a 7-foot spear is usually enough to end the encounter immediately.

### "What about multiple attackers?"

Multiple attackers with guns beats any single defender, spear or firearm. But a spear gives you reach to control doorways and chokepoints. Stand in a hallway with a long Assegai and tell me how many people can get past you simultaneously.

### "Isn't this just fantasy roleplay?"

The Zulu killed British soldiers with these things. Boar hunters still use them because they work. Historical reenactors use them because they teach actual combat skills. 

It's not fantasy. It's proven technology that happens to be 500 years old.

## The Real Reason

Here's the truth: a spear isn't "better" than a gun in absolute terms. It's different. It offers:

- **Silence** — No hearing damage, no alerting the neighborhood
- **Simplicity** — No jams, no misfires, no ammunition to buy
- **Reach** — 4-7 feet of standoff distance
- **Intimidation** — Nobody wants to fight the person holding a war spear
- **Legality** — Minimal regulation in most jurisdictions
- **Training** — Natural, intuitive use

## The Bottom Line

We're not anti-gun. Guns are excellent tools for many situations. But they're not the *only* tool, and they're not the *best* tool for every situation.

If you want effective home defense without the noise, legal complexity, and training burden of firearms, a spear is a legitimate option. It's not weird. It's not cringe. It's historically proven, legally simple, and remarkably effective.

Plus, your friends will think it's cool. And isn't that what really matters?
